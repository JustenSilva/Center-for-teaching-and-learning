Use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in enhancing the quality of education is something that almost everyone is interested in, these days. Concepts like open content, open data, and open resources, along with notions of transparency and easy access to data and information is becoming a value. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) are being widely explored as alternatives and supplements to traditional university courses. The workforce demands skills from college graduates that are more often acquired from informal learning experiences than in universities. Education paradigms are shifting to include online learning, hybrid learning, and collaborative models. At the same time, the teaching paradigms across all sectors too, besides including the above, demand much more teamwork and collaboration. As the abundance of resources and relationships made easily accessible via the Internet grows, we are ever more challenged to revisit our roles as educators. 

Faculty training still does not acknowledge the fact that digital media literacy continues its rise in importance as a key skill in every discipline and profession. The demand for personalized learning is not adequately supported by current technology or practices on campus. Economic pressures and new models of education are bringing unprecedented competition to the traditional models of higher education. The emergence of new scholarly forms of authoring, publishing, and researching, outpace sufficient and scalable modes of assessment. Many challenges impacting technology uptake are grounded in everyday realities that often make it difficult to learn about, much less adopt, new tools and approaches.
 
A number of workshops, seminars and training programs in this area are being held regularly. There are also many conferences and publications in this area. However, still the adoption and effective utilization of technology in education is low. One of the contributing factors is the lack of awareness at the level of teachers and institutions, and perhaps the lack of access to usable resources and inadequate sharing of experiences among those working in this field. A centre like this will help address this gap, by offering useful inputs and allowing for sharing of experiences with the relevant community. 
 
The infrastructure for the centre has been partly funded by RUSA (Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan)
